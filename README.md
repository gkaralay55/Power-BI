# Python data transformation in csv file  explaination

This python program will make following format changes in the downloaded csv file:
•	It will merge the columns ‘Place’ and ‘State’ and make it one column with format ‘State-Place’
•	It will transpose ‘Years and Population’ i.e. after running this python code the newly created csv file will have ‘Years’ and ‘Population’ as columns instead of rows
•	A new column ‘Student First Name - Rank’ will be created which will rank the ‘State-City’ based on population.
